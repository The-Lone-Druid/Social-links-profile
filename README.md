### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use Tailwind CSS to style a web page. I gained a deeper understanding of:

- **Semantic HTML5 markup**: Ensuring that the HTML structure is meaningful and accessible.
- **CSS custom properties**: Utilizing CSS variables to maintain consistent styling across the project.
- **Flexbox and CSS Grid**: Creating responsive layouts that adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Mobile-first workflow**: Designing the mobile version of the site first and then enhancing it for larger screens.

Additionally, I improved my skills in debugging and optimizing CSS for better performance and cross-browser compatibility.

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to continue improving my skills in the following areas:

- **Advanced CSS techniques**: Exploring more complex CSS features such as animations, transitions, and custom properties.
- **JavaScript frameworks**: Learning and implementing popular frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular to build more dynamic and interactive web applications.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring that my web projects are accessible to all users by following best practices and guidelines.
- **Performance optimization**: Focusing on techniques to improve the performance and loading times of web pages.
- **Backend development**: Gaining a better understanding of backend technologies and how to integrate them with front-end applications.

By focusing on these areas, I aim to create more robust, efficient, and user-friendly web applications.
